## API Eins

API Eins is purely a lab project to play around with Flask.

Eins means "one" in German. I called the API "Eins" because it's the first Restful API that I ever created.

Yep! It's a fully fledged CRUD API. ðŸ˜ƒ

Here are a few of the available endpoints:

**/items**

Request a list of all items that have been added to the API.

**/item/\<name\>**

Add an item (product) to the API. For example, you can use /item/potatoe to add a potatoe ðŸ¥” to the API.

**/stores**

Items can be associated to specific stores. This endpoint allows users to request a list of all stores and see which items are associated with them.
